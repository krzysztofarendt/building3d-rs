Read PHYSICS.md and FVM.md. Then analyze the current implementation status of the energy simulation engine. Look also at examples:
- bestest_600_energy
- bestest_energy_suite

Explain what is the current energy simulation engine implementation and what are the physical assumptions.
Compare our assumptions with what is implemented in EnergyPlus software
(https://energyplus.net/).

Finally identify gaps between our engine and EnergyPlus and prepare a plan how to fix them.

For reference, I am attaching results.png which contain the comparison of our simulation with EnergyPlys for Case 600 and Case 900.
